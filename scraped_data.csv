Few pointers that can help you pick the right shade are mentioned below:<br data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<ul>
<li>Opt for shades that are one shade lighter than your natural brow hair</li>
<li>When confused between shades, opt for cool-tone or neutral hues instead of warmer hues. For more brow makeup tips, checkout our article on <span style=""color: #2b00ff;""><a href=""https://blog.sugarcosmetics.com/how-to-ace-your-eyebrow-game/"" style=""color: #2b00ff;"" target=""_blank"">how to get thick, amazing eyebrows on fleek</a>!</span>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Q. Should your eyebrows match your hair colour?</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong>A.</strong> Your eyebrows should be one to two shades darker than your hair. Avoid matching your brow colour exactly to your hair colour as that may look unnatural. Here are few eyebrow makeup tips that can help - For dark black hair beauties, you can choose dark brown, brunette or medium brow shade. 01 Jerry Brown (Medium Brown), 03 Woody Scooby (Deep Brown) and 04 Felix Onyx (Dark Blackish Brown) are good picks and work best for most Indian skin tones. If you have light brown hair or blonde, look for a brow pencil with some cool undertone hues to it. You can also mix in something with a warm undertone so the colour doesn't look ashy or gray. Try our 02 Taupe Tom (Grey Brown) which works well for fair skin tones. This shade also works for people with gray hair!<br><br><strong>Q. How to use this eyebrow definer and get the best results?</strong><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong>A.</strong> Arch Arrival Brow Definer is a retractable brow pencil which is quite easy to use!<br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Simply start with filling and defining your brows. Make sure you draw individual lines<br data-mce-fragment=""1"">near or between natural hairs using gentle strokes. Brush your hair and the product well using the brow spoolie.

<p> <strong>How To Apply</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start by taking a colour that is a shade or two darker than your skin tone and run it back and forth onto your crease as a transition shade</li>
<li>Start blending at the point where you want the deepest colour, like the outer corner and aim toward the place where you want the lightest colour.  By doing this, a gradient will be created by the colour choice alone</li>
<li>Next go for the shimmer shade on the lid to get that pop. Use the doe-tip sponge applicator or a damp flat brush or your finger for that additional depth</li>
<li>Use a darker shade on the crease to define the eye shape. Start applying from the outer corner of the eye, making a ‘V’, and blend it halfway through the eyelid with the round eyeshadow blending brush.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Easy Shade Guide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>lightest </strong>colour usually works well as a brow bone highlighter.</li>
<li>The <strong>second lightest </strong>colour usually looks good on the lid and creates a base to apply the shade of your choice, matte or shimmer</li>
<li>The <strong>second darkest </strong>colour usually works best on the crease</li>
<li>The <strong>darkest </strong>colour usually works best in the outer corner</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits: </strong>Each of the shades in the <strong>SUGAR Blend The Rules Eyeshadow Palette</strong> range is richly pigmented, blendable without loss of pay-off and lasts for hours without creasing or smudging. This product is dermatologically tested &amp; approved and 100% safe for your skin. The dual chromatic and high foil shades give intense coverage.</p>

Uptown Curl Lengthening Mascara - 01 Black Beauty (Black),"Get ready to stir up a storm with a wink!<br> <br>Here is the <strong>SUGAR Uptown Curl Lengthening Mascara </strong>- fulfilling all your lash fantasies. Caution: You are about to be the center of attraction with this volumizing, lengthening &amp; curling mascara that comes with a hi-tech curved brush &amp; an extreme black formula. This magic wand easily pulls through each lash smoothly and lays down a generous amount of product in one swipe - giving your lashes a gravity defying lift, an instant curl and a dramatic voluminous look that’s smudge-proof and clump-free, lasting for 8+ hours.
<p><strong>How to Apply:</strong> Prepare for the lash lift! Hold your mascara and position the wand in such a way that the claw brush spoons the curve of your lashes. Starting from the root, sweep the wand upward, guiding the shape of your lashes. For extra definition and fullness, wiggle the brush from side to side. Apply multiple coats for volume. Now move to your lower lashes: smoothen the lashes with the hollow side of the brush, from the center to the outer corner and return towards the inner corner of the eyelid. The result: incredible control for insane lashes!</p>
<p><strong>Benefits: </strong>Create fluttery fullness with this ergonomically curved brush with fine bristles that coats the product on to each lash giving special attention to the inner lashes, finally saving you from the struggle to maneuver it in all different angles. The ultra-creamy, fibrous texture comes in a formula that’s not too dry, not too wet, lightweight and intensely black. This unique formula also boosts the growth of your natural lashes, fuels thickness and strength on regular use.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Details:</strong> The <strong>SUGAR Uptown Curl Lengthening Mascara </strong>is paraben-free. Easy removal with warm water or makeup remover. One swipe of either loosens the film and allows the formula to slide off easily.<br> <br>Available in the shade ""<strong>01 Black Beauty (Black)</strong>"".<br><br>Net Weight: 5g<br> <br> <strong>List of Ingredients:</strong> Water, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Synthetic Beeswax, Candelilla Cera, Polyester-5, Palmitic Acid, Paraffin, Oryza Sativa (Rice Bran) Wax, Stearic Acid, Triethanolamine, Ammonium Acrylates Copolymer, Nylon-6, Glycol Montanate, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Copernicia Cerifera Cera, Sudium Dehydrocetate, Caprylyl Glycol and Hydrated Silica.

Arrested For Overstay Waterproof Eyeliner - 01 I'll Be Black (Black),"<p>Always on the go but can't live without a little wing? Your search for that perfect feline flick ends right here, right now! The <strong>SUGAR Arrested For Overstay Waterproof Eyeliner</strong> (quite literally a pen!) glides on smoothly and stays on until you say when. So whether you’re a makeup newbie or a pro - creating a range of eye-opening looks, from statement bold graphic lines to carefully crafted cat eyes has never been this easy. But wait, there’s more to your newest SUGAR crush – did we mention that it’s 100% waterproof? Be it sweaty workouts or dips in the sea, this new must-have is the wonder liner your collection is missing. Grab it now!<br> <br> <strong>How to Apply:</strong> For a subtle defining line, draw the tip of the pen from the inner to the outer eye corner, sticking as close to the lash line as possible. Slant the pen and add more pressure to create a bolder line or continue to layer until you achieve desired definition.<br> <br> <strong>Benefits:</strong> Designed with a precision tip for complete control over your eye artistry, the eyeliner delivers super-subtle lines and flicks with an ease that you can build up slowly for a more dramatic look. The blacker-than-black pigment is perfectly opaque and won’t fade, run, crack or melt come rain or shine.<br> <br> <strong>Additional Details:</strong> Shake the eyeliner pen before using so the formula saturates the felt tip. For best results, wipe tip with a damp tissue before applying to prevent powder build-up, which may cause the eyeliner pen to dry out.

<h5>Commonly asked questions</h5>
Q. How many times should I apply sunscreen?<br data-mce-fragment=""1"">A. You should apply sunscreen 15 to 20 minutes before you go outside so it has time to get absorbed in your skin, then reapply at 2-3 hour intervals throughout the day. Reapply sunscreen more frequently just after you’ve been swimming, as the water will wash it off. The same is true if you’ve been sweating, so you may need to apply more than every 2 hours.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Q. How is the formula of this sunscreen?<br data-mce-fragment=""1"">A. This SPF30 powered sunscreen is designed to protect and shield your skin in the gentlest way. It has a non-greasy texture that feels extremely light on skin, absorbs super quick and doesn’t leave behind any sticky feel.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Q. Is arginine good for skin?<br data-mce-fragment=""1"">A. Arginine, or L-arginine, is a semi-essential amino acid and is known for its skin-caring properties. It helps maintain the skin's moisture and smoothness. It also functions as an antioxidant to help naturally build collagen production, promoting elasticity and vitality.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Q. What does a broad spectrum sunscreen mean?<br data-mce-fragment=""1"">A. The term ‘broad-spectrum sunscreen’ is used to describe a sunscreen that can help protect skin from the sun's harmful ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) rays. Since both these sunrays can lead to sunburn and skin damage, it is always safe to use a sunscreen that offers broad-spectrum SPF protection.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1"">Q. Is this sunscreen vegan?<br data-mce-fragment=""1"">A.

<h5>Commonly asked questions</h5>
<span data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Q. What is a cleansing balm?<br>A. </strong>A cleansing balm is essentially what it sounds like—a thick, rich balm that can be used to cleanse your skin of dirt, oil, makeup and impurities. This type of face cleanser is formulated with natural oils. If you go back to your school days, you may remember the phrase “like attracts like”—which is exactly how face cleansing balms work. The oils in the formula not only rid your skin of all that build-up, but they also help restore moisture, leaving your <span style=""color: #2b00ff;""><a style=""color: #2b00ff;"" href=""https://blog.sugarcosmetics.com/5-tips-for-an-effective-and-simple-skincare-routine/"" data-mce-fragment=""1"" data-mce-href=""https://blog.sugarcosmetics.com/5-tips-for-an-effective-and-simple-skincare-routine/"" target=""_blank"">skin</a></span> clean, hydrated and intensely nourished. This is a huge factor in why they’re a popular option for dry, sensitive, and mature skin types as they supply the skin with ample nourishment and remove all dirt and makeup too.<strong data-mce-fragment=""1""><br><br>Q. Do cleansing balms work for all skin types?<br>A. </strong>Cleansing balms are so skin friendly that they work for all skin types and concerns. They work especially well for those with dry, dehydrated, and even sensitive skin conditions. They’re also great for oily skin as oil breaks down oil, essentially regulating your sebum production, making your skin less oily with regular use.<strong data-mce-fragment=""1""><br><br></strong></span>

<strong>Q. Can I use the SUGAR Coffee Culture Cleansing Balm Stick as a makeup remover?<br></strong><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">A.</strong><span data-mce-fragment=""1""> Yes, you can! Cleansing balms are the best makeup removers because most makeup products are oil-based and are designed for long wear! The nourishing oils in this cleansing balm break down these oils in your makeup, making removal of dirt, makeup, and debris easy-peasy. Just one use will reveal softer, smoother, hydrated skin!<br><br><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Q. Should I use a cleansing balm if I don't wear makeup?<br></strong><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">A.</strong> You definitely can! Even if you don't wear makeup, you do need an oil-based face cleanser to melt away sebum, pollutants and dirt from your skin.
